# Samsung Nordics: Site Migration, Redesign and SEO

In early 2014 Samsung Electronics Nordics websites came in two variants: mobile ([m.samsung.com](http://m.samsung.com/)) and desktop ([samsung.com](http://samsung.com/)). During that year we worked hard to migrate the site to a new, uniform, responsive website. The snapshot with light background is from January 2014, the snapshot with dark background is from February 2015. Both snapshots were taken with [Internet Archive: Wayback Machine].
